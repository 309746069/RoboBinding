<h2>Eclipse integration</h2>
<p>Needless to say, you will need both <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> and the <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/eclipse-adt.html">Android Development Tools</a> plugin installed.</p>
<p>If you want to use AspectJ to auto-generate the property change event code in your presentation models (recommended), you will need to install the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/ajdt/">AspectJ Development Tools (AJDT) plugin</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have it installed, create a new Android project as normal, and then on the project right-click→Configure→Convert to AspectJ Project. This will add the AspectJ natures to your .project file, and you should be good to go.</p>
<p>Also, don't forget to add the RoboBinding.jar to your classpath. Right click on project→Properties→Java Build Path→Libraries→Add JARs. Alternatively for adding the RoboBinding.jar to your dependencies via Maven, see the relevant <a href="/maven.html">section</a>.</p>
