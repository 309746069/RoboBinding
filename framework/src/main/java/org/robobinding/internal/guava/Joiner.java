/**
 * An object which joins pieces of text (specified as an array, {@link Iterable}, varargs or even a
 * {@link Map}) with a separator. It either appends the results to an {@link Appendable} or returns
 * them as a {@link String}. Example: <pre>   {@code
 *
 *   Joiner joiner = Joiner.on("; ").skipNulls();
 *    . . .
 *   return joiner.join("Harry", null, "Ron", "Hermione");}</pre>
 *
 * <p>This returns the string {@code "Harry; Ron; Hermione"}. Note that all input elements are
 * converted to strings using {@link Object#toString()} before being appended.
 *
 * <p>If neither {@link #skipNulls()} nor {@link #useForNull(String)} is specified, the joining
 * methods will throw {@link NullPointerException} if any given element is null.
 *
 * <p><b>Warning: joiner instances are always immutable</b>; a configuration method such as {@code
 * useForNull} has no effect on the instance it is invoked on! You must store and use the new joiner
 * instance returned by the method. This makes joiners thread-safe, and safe to store as {@code
 * static final} constants. <pre>   {@code
 *
 *   // Bad! Do not do this!
 *   Joiner joiner = Joiner.on(',');
 *   joiner.skipNulls(); // does nothing!
 *   return joiner.join("wrong", null, "wrong");}</pre>
 *   
 * <p>See the Guava User Guide article on <a href=
 * "http://code.google.com/p/guava-libraries/wiki/StringsExplained#Joiner">{@code Joiner}</a>.
