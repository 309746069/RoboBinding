title: Getting started - ProGuard

<h2>ProGuard</h2>
<p>RoboBinding requires that all classes which implement ObservableProperties (i.e. presentation models) have their names and public methods left intact. Additionally, we need to preserve all annotations.</p>

<p>To achieve this, add the following directives to your ProGuard configuration:</p>

{% highlight php %}
-keep class * implements org.robobinding.property.ObservableProperties {
    public *** *(...);
}

-keepattributes *Annotation*
{% endhighlight %}
