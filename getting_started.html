<h2>Environment setup</h2>
<p>RoboBinding has been developed and tested with <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> (we hope to bring improved support for other IDEs in the future). It can also optionally be used with the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/maven-android-plugin/">Android Maven plugin</a>.</p>
<p>In order to support pojo presentation models, RoboBinding allows you to decorate your classes with the @PresentationModel annotation. In order to transparently fire the necessary property change events, RoboBinding uses <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/aspectj/">AspectJ</a> to generate the required code. Plugins are available to support AspectJ development in both Eclipse and Maven.</p>
<p>If AspectJ is not your thing, then you can extend the AbstractPresentationModel class included in the library. Don't forget to fire the necessary property change events whenever you need to synchronize with your views (helper methods are available).</p>
